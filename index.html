I kind of hated everything because of the fact that I have social anxiety. And I don&#39;t know where to begin with it. It&#39;s like a curse and no matter how hard I try to want to speak myself up I&#39;m just lost in my worried thoughts. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">I have a lot of things going on in my mind that I don&#39;t know how to calm myself, as if I&#39;m almost about to panic. I just can&#39;t seem to get my mind off of the embarrassment that happened when the teacher asked me and I was not able to say anything. I feel so bad to myself about it. I don&#39;t know why but I have this fear of failure and the expectations and attention that was centered to me was overwhelming. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">I just want to skip class but I&#39;m afraid that it will drag my grades down. Because I&#39;m still quite conscious of my grades. But here&#39;s the thing, I speak normal when I&#39;m comfortable around people I know. Maybe the anxiety comes from the fact that our teacher expects a lot from us because of the reputation our university holds. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">After all the stress I had to bear this day I decided to take a walk outside. I went to the park in the evening around 7 PM. It&#39;s quite nice to have a fresh air. It clears my mind. And how it relaxes me to stroll around a place other than my room. I&#39;m stuck there all day and I think I might go crazy if I stay there longer. My mood already lightened with the cold breeze that hits my skin and the beam of the moonlight than shines in the darkness. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">After a few minutes of walking around I decided to sit in front of a fountain and just stared at the moon above. It was so beautiful and peaceful. When I checked my phone I remembered that I still have to buy something. So I immediately got up and I accidentally bumped into someone. I tried to apologize to the person and I looked up to see the face. It was quite dark but his features were prominent. His eyes still managed to glimmer in the dark while his hair is covered with a hoodie. I then got myself out of the trance and hurriedly walked away. While I was walking away I just can&#39;t seem to get out my mind what just happened. So I looked back again and I saw him who was already looking at me. I nodded my head out of respect and smiled and looked away.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">Well that was a night. I already got home and I can&#39;t seem to get that boy out of my head. It&#39;s a strange feeling but I just felt something when I saw his eyes. It&#39;s full of emotions with a hidden mysteriousness to it. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">---</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">The next day we had classes. I was waiting for a bus to come by at the stop until one came. It was already full so I had no choice but to stand while riding. After a few minutes the bus stopped again and someone went up to ride the bus. He was tall and was wearing a school uniform. Wait! The uniform is quite familiar. He goes to my school. Oh well I tried to slip it off my mind. Then conductor handed the person in front of me the ticket and he gave it to me. When I took it, I saw his face and he was very familiar. I was dumbfounded. It was the same person whom I bumped into yesterday. This all seems so coincidental already. When he passed me the ticket, he also stared into my face. I&#39;m not sure if he remembers me but his brows raised when he looked at me. And then he quickly turned away.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">The bus driver is quite insane because he drives insanely as well. He does not seem to consider the people who&#39;s standing in the middle. And given that I&#39;m wearing high heels it becomes much harder for me to balance myself out. Luckily after a few miles, a lady walked out of the bus and there was a free seat in front the same guy. He offered me the seat and I gladly took it. Ughh!!! These high heels were killing me earlier but now I could let my feet rest. But I can&#39;t hide my shyness since I feel his presence behind me.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">After that long ride I already got to school and I went out first. When I looked behind he was still riding the bus. I was wondering where he&#39;s going to. Oh well! It&#39;s not my business. So I went inside the school. I looked at my watch and there&#39;s only 3 minutes left before our classes would start. I hurriedly walked to our classroom despite wearing this damn high heels. I swear that my feet already earned many soles. And one time it was bad that it was already bleeding. I had no choice but to endure the pain. And now that I&#39;m almost late, I was panicking. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">Finally! I got there in time. Our teacher saw me and my classmates were also looking at me. But I tried not to look at them because as I said I&#39;m not a fan of too much attention. Sometimes I just want to hide from them because it gets draining to be around them too much, except for my friends. But I can&#39;t deny that my classmates are unruly and wild and chaotic. I just can&#39;t stand too much noise. It&#39;s overstimulating for me. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">Classes ended and I was about to buy my lunch. I wait up for my friends so that we could all go together. God I&#39;m so hungry that I could just eat anything. But there are also times that I&#39;m so hungry that I just want to throw up. But this time I can&#39;t help it. I had to eat. So I walked fast and got to the kiosk where I always buy. They always had a lot of choices to choose from although it&#39;s a bit pricey. I then got my lunch and headed to an empty table. As I was walking, an awkward thing happened. This student almost bumped into me because we&#39;re both not paying attention to where we&#39;re going. I can&#39;t blame myself because my eyes were too fixated on the empty area before anyone could take it. And just in time my peripheral vision were a great help because a disaster was prevented before it even happened. I almost crashed into him. And by him it&#39;s that guy again. Is this all too much coincidental? Why does things like this happen? Does this even happen in real life? It&#39;s so awkward because wherever direction I go he faces the same. So when I go to the left, he also goes to the left. And when I turned into the other direction, he also unfortunately went to the same. His friends had already left him. And due to my people pleasing personality I apologized to him. He just smiled at me. I stopped moving and let him take the way to stop further embarrassment to myself. And he went on his way catching up to his friends. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">I finally took the empty seat and waited for my friends there. They finally came after me and we all ate our food. While eating I accidentally zoned out in my head while replaying the scenario that happened earlier. I wanted to get it off my mind but I tend to overthink things way too much. I just can&#39;t help it. And I can&#39;t help it but wonder why the hell did he smile at me. There was a sudden change in his expressions. Although when he was with his friends I felt that he was in a good mood already. But it&#39;s weird that he looked at me weirdly earlier while we rode that bus. The same thing when we met at the park yesterday. Ughh! This is so weird. I hope I don&#39;t see him again. Although I kind of want to. I just to don&#39;t want to bump into him like that.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">—</p><p style="text-align: left;">After a few weeks we met again in a booth at school. I was looking at the merchandise which were a lot to choose from such as stickers, pins, stationeries and many more. I just couldn&#39;t help but find them all too cute because I&#39;m fond of them. And then one merch caught my eye. A card of my favorite character. As I was about to pick it up I bumped my hands with someone. I look up to see who it is and it&#39;s him again. Why does this things happen to me? I feel my heart beat faster so I took my hand away to let him take it. He then asked me, “Do you want it?”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">As I heard his soft voice I can&#39;t help but feel even more fluttery with a thousand of butterflies in my stomach. Why does he have to sound that way? It&#39;s way too attractive and charming. But hey self! Focus. So I answered him trying to keep my voice sound calm, “It&#39;s alright. You can take it.”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Are you sure?”, he asked again while beaming a smile at me. Ahhhh my heart! I can already feel that my face is blushing hard from just hearing his voice.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Yeah. Just take it.”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Okay thanks!” He replied. And now I can just die with the softness of his expressions. I could just melt right there for him. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">But then the vendor brought me back to reality when she interrupted, “Excuse me Miss! But I still have a few stock left in here if you want.” I was so delighted when I heard that because it was still my favorite character. And I can&#39;t deny that I would spend for these things.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Really? Yes please. I would like to buy it. Thank you.” I handed her the money and he also paid for his. </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">I was about to walk away when he catch up to me. It was visible how his eyes were sparkling. And then he asked me again, “So you like her as well? I didn&#39;t expect to find a fan of her in here.”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Are you kidding me?” I said to him with my voice full of enthusiasm. It seems that we both got each other&#39;s attention. “I even have a lot more of the merchandise at home.”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Ha really! I guess you&#39;re a true fan.” One question led to another until we were both talking for a few hours already. We were so engaged with each other. And this weird encounter has led me to finding someone who could be my friend. I kind of did not expect that because I am still an introvert deep inside. But my first impression of him was quite wrong. I though he was aloof and then weird but now I find him more interesting.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">We haven&#39;t noticed how much time had passed because we were busy talking to each other. But then my friends came and they called out to me. We had a plan of going home together so I said my goodbye to him. “I hope I could see you again next time. It was really nice meeting you??”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Lor. Hahaha! We were enjoying our conversation too much that we forgot to introduce ourselves. But yeah I hope I could see you again next time. By the way, if you want there&#39;s an anime convention at the Arena.”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Yes just message me the date and time. And before I forget, I&#39;m Jay!”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“So it&#39;s a yes then. Okay I&#39;ll message you. Byee Jay!”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">“Yeah same to you Lor!”</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">Ah I can&#39;t believe that he just asked me out. Is it a date? Could you even count it as one?</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p></article></section></body></html>
